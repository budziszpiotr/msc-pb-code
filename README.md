# Repository for Thesis: [Computational reduction of reconstruction artifacts in stitchingbased biomedical com puted tomography]

This repository contains the code developed for the thesis titled [Computational reduction of reconstruction artifacts in stitchingbased biomedical com puted tomography]. 
The project is divided into multiple Jupyter notebooks covering phases 1, 2, and 3 of the thesis. 
Additionally, there is a batch file with STP commands and scripts used in their execution.

The dataset and files mentioned in the notebook belong to the CFU (Center for Fast Ultrasound Imaging) at DTU (Technical University of Denmark).

## Additional Resources

Apart from the repository with scripts created for this project, here are links to other repositories used:

- Core Imaging Library (CIL) repository: [CIL-Demos](https://github.com/TomographicImaging/CIL-Demos)
  - Contains demos used as a basis in this project.

- SYRMEP Tomo Project (STP) software: [STP-Core](https://github.com/ElettraSciComp/STP-Core/tree/master/STP-Core)
  - Scripts developed by Elettra used to handle the data of the kidney dataset.
